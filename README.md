First, open the server program, then open the client program. In these two programs, you can open your own live broadcast, and the client program can receive the broadcast from your camera, and vice versa. The client can also open a live broadcast from its own server, and the client can receive it. You can also conduct a text message conversation between you and the client, and you can also send and receive images to and from the server and client.
This is an open-source program, and you can develop it however you like.
Some notes about using this application:

1. You cannot use live broadcasting and send or receive text messages, or send and receive images, at the same time.
2. Live broadcasting must be used separately. If you want to send text messages, you must exit both programs and open them in order, sending the messages first.
3. Also, sending or receiving images should not be done after using live broadcasting, as this method of use can cause errors.
4. If you want to send or receive images, you must first use the send or receive image function before using live broadcasting.
